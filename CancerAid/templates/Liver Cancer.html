         <p>  The malignancy of the liver is known as liver cancer. The liver is the body's biggest glandular organ, and it plays a number of important roles in keeping the body free of poisons and hazardous chemicals. The liver is found below the ribs in the right upper quadrant of the belly. It's in charge of creating bile, a chemical that aids in the digestion of fats, vitamins, and other nutrients. This important organ also stores nutrients like glucose, allowing you to stay nourished even when you aren't eating. It also degrades poisons and drugs. When cancer strikes the liver, it damages liver cells and impairs the organ's capacity to function normally. Primary and secondary liver cancers are the two types of liver cancer. Primary liver cancer starts in the liver cells. When cancer cells from another organ move to the liver, it is known as secondary liver cancer.

         <p style="color:#9b5567;font-size:18px;"> Causes   </p>

         Liver cancer develops when the DNA of liver cells changes (mutates). The DNA of a cell is the substance that contains the instructions for all of your body's chemical processes. Changes in these instructions are caused by DNA mutations. As a result, cells may develop out of control and eventually form a tumor, which is a mass of malignant cells.In certain cases, such as with chronic hepatitis infections, the etiology of liver cancer is known. However, liver cancer can occur in persons who have no underlying illnesses, and the etiology remains unknown.
         Men are up to seven times more likely than women to develop liver cancer. Among hepatitis B virus carriers, men are up to three times more likely to develop liver cancer than women.

           <p style="color:rgb(27, 25, 180);font-size:20px;"> Liver cancer comes in a variety of forms, </p>
        

               <p>The numerous cells that make up the liver give rise to the many forms of primary liver cancer. Primary liver cancer can begin as a single lump in the liver, or it can begin in several locations throughout the liver at the same time.Multiple cancer growth sites are more common in people with substantial liver impairment. The following are the most common kinds of primary liver cancer:<br/>
               
                 <p> Hepatocellular carcinoma:   Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), commonly known as hepatoma, is the most prevalent kind of liver cancer, accounting for approximately 75% of all liver malignancies. The hepatocytes, which make up the majority of the liver cells, acquire this disease. It can extend from the liver to the pancreas, intestines, and stomach, among other organs. People with substantial liver impairment from alcohol misuse are much more prone to develop HCC.</p>
                 <p> Cholangiocarcinoma:         Cholangiocarcinoma, also known as bile duct cancer, is a kind of cancer that originates in the liver's tiny, tube-like bile ducts. These ducts transport bile from the liver to the gallbladder, which aids digestion. Intrahepatic bile duct cancer occurs when cancer develops in a segment of the channels inside the liver. Extrahepatic bile duct cancer occurs when cancer develops in a segment of the ducts outside the liver. Bile duct cancer accounts for between 10% to 20% of all liver cancers.</p>
                 <p> Angiosarcoma of the liver:  Liver angiosarcoma is a rare kind of liver cancer that starts in the liver's blood veins. Because this sort of cancer progresses so swiftly, it's usually detected at a later stage.</p>
                 <p> Hepatoblastoma:             Hepatoblastoma is a kind of liver cancer that is exceedingly uncommon. It's almost commonly detected in youngsters, particularly those under the age of three.</p>

         <p style="color:#9b239b;font-size:18px;">  Factors that are at risk  </p>

             <ul> 

               Primary liver cancer is caused by a number of factors, including:

                     <li>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection raises the risk of liver cancer.
                         <li> Cirrhosis, Scar tissue forms in the liver as a result of this gradual and irreversible disorder, increasing your chances of getting liver cancer.
                              <li> Hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease are two liver illnesses that can raise the risk of liver cancer.
                                   <li>Those with  blood sugar issue have a higher risk of liver cancer than those who do not.
                                        <li>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition that affects people who do use alcohol. The risk of liver cancer is increased when fat accumulates in the liver.
                                             <li>Aflatoxins are poisonous fungi that develop on crops that have been improperly preserved. Aflatoxin contamination may occur in crops such as grains and nuts, which can then wind up in meals manufactured from these goods.
                                                  <li> Drinking more than a modest quantity of alcohol on a daily basis for a long time might cause irreparable liver damage and raise your risk of liver cancer.
                         
                         

             </ul> <br/>

                      <li>Cirrhosis is a liver scarring condition that raises the risk of liver cancer. If you do the following, you can lower your chances of developing cirrhosis.
                           <li>If you must drink alcohol, do it in moderation. Limit your alcohol consumption if you want to do so. This implies no more than one drink each day for ladies. This implies no more than two drinks each day for guys.
                                <li>Maintain a healthy body mass index (BMI). If your present weight is healthy, make an effort to keep it that way by eating well and exercising most days of the week. Reduce the number of calories you consume each day and increase the quantity of activity you perform if you need to lose weight. Aim for a gradual weight loss of 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) every week.
